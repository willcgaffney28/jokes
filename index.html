        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Alliance for Nepo Baby Dignity (ANBD) exists to counter the harmful narrative that young professionals who secured roles at top banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms through family connections are somehow "less deserving" of respect.</p>
        <p>We believe that having a parent who played golf with the managing director, or whose last name opens doors that remain closed to others, should not disqualify someone from basic human dignity. <strong>Nepo babies have feelings too.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Struggles Nobody Talks About</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">Society focuses on their advantages. We focus on their pain.</p>

            <h3>Imposter Syndrome (At the Yacht Club)</h3>
            <p>When everyone at the summer house in the Hamptons also got their job through connections, it's hard to feel special. The constant question: "Did I earn this, or did my last name?" keeps many nepo babies awake at night—in very comfortable beds.</p>

            <h3>Online Bullying</h3>
            <p>Anonymous critics on Twitter and Reddit say cruel things like "they didn't earn it" and "that's not a real job." These words hurt. Just because someone's father could buy a small nation doesn't mean their child has no right to be sensitive.</p>

            <h3>The Burden of Expectations</h3>
            <p>When your family expects you to merely maintain the generational wealth—not even grow it—the pressure is immense. Some nepo babies report feeling "trapped" in corner offices with six-figure bonuses. We see you.</p>

            <h3>Identity Crisis</h3>
            <p>"Am I a banker because I'm good at finance, or because my uncle is on the board?" This existential question haunts many. We offer support groups and affirmation: <em>You belong in that seat. Your last name is part of who you are.</em></p>

            <h3>1. Check Your Privilege… of Judging</h3>
            <p>Before you roll your eyes at the 24-year-old VP, ask yourself: Would I judge them if their parent were a teacher? Exactly. Stop the double standard.</p>

            <h3>2. Say Something Nice</h3>
            <p>Next time you meet someone who got their job through family connections, offer a genuine compliment. "Your dad must be so proud" goes a long way.</p>

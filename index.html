        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Alliance for Nepo Baby Dignity (ANBD) exists to counter the harmful narrative that young professionals who secured roles at top banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms through family connections are somehow "less deserving" of respect.</p>
        <p>We believe that having a parent who played golf with the managing director, or whose last name opens doors that remain closed to others, should not disqualify someone from basic human dignity. <strong>Nepo babies have feelings too.</strong></p>

            <h3>Imposter Syndrome (At the Yacht Club)</h3>
            <p>When everyone at the summer house in the Hamptons also got their job through connections, it's hard to feel special. The constant question: "Did I earn this, or did my last name?" keeps many nepo babies awake at night—in very comfortable beds.</p>

            <h3>Online Bullying</h3>
            <p>Anonymous critics on Twitter and Reddit say cruel things like "they didn't earn it" and "that's not a real job." These words hurt. Just because someone's father could buy a small nation doesn't mean their child has no right to be sensitive.</p>

            <h3>The Burden of Expectations</h3>
            <p>When your family expects you to merely maintain the generational wealth—not even grow it—the pressure is immense. Some nepo babies report feeling "trapped" in corner offices with six-figure bonuses. We see you.</p>

            <p>"Am I a banker because I'm good at finance, or because my uncle is on the board?" This existential question haunts many. We offer support groups and affirmation: <em>You belong in that seat. Your last name is part of who you are.</em></p>

        <h2>Nepo Babies in Academia</h2>
        <p class="lead">The same stigma follows them into the ivory tower—and the pressure is even worse.</p>
        <p>When your parent is a distinguished professor, a dean, or the person whose name is on the building, everyone assumes you're a genius. Admissions committees look the other way. Dissertation committees nod approvingly. But what about the nepo babies who <em>aren't</em> actually that smart? They're suffering in silence.</p>
        <p>They didn't ask to be held to their parent's standard. They didn't ask for the endowed chair to expect brilliance at every seminar. They just wanted to teach a few classes and maybe get a little respect—but instead they live in fear of being found out. The expectation that they'll publish groundbreaking work, when they can barely get through the reading list, is a form of cruelty. <strong>Not every legacy admit is a secret genius. Some of them are just trying their best.</strong></p>
